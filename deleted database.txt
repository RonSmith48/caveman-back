Because we have a custom user model, we must create that first before running anything else.

1. Ensure all the migration files are deleted from the migration folders
2. run [python manage.py makemigrations users]
3. then [python manage.py migrate]
4. for some reason we have to run makemigrations on each individual app and then migrate
[python manage.py makemigrations common settings] ...continue the list
[python manage.py migrate]
5. [python manage.py createsuperuser]
